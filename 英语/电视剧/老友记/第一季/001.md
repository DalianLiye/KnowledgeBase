- There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.

- C'mon, you're going out with the guy. There's gotta be something wrong with him.

- All right, Joey. Be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

- Wait, does he eat chalk? Just, 'cause I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- Oh!

- Okay, everybody relax. Relax. This is not even a date. It's not. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

- Sounds like a date to me.

- Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.

- Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

- Then I look down and  I realize there is a phone...there.

- Instead of.

- That's right!

- Never had that dream.

- No

- All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.

- And they weren't looking at you before?!

- Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,which is very-very weird, because she never calls me!

-
